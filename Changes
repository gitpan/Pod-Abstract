Revision history for Pod-Abstract

0.15    12/03/2009
        Improved documentation. Added some real documentation for
        Pod::Abstract::Path. Had an attempt at fixing the compile
        issues for Perl 5.6. No significant changes in function.

0.14    03/03/2009
        Improved paf filter suite. Bug fixes. paf defaults to "load as
        perldoc". Allow mandatory positional arguments for filters.

0.10    28/02/2009
        Package build with functional library and "paf" utility.
